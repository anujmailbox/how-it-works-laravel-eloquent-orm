## Instructor: [Matthew Machuga][instructor url]


Laravel's Eloquent object-relational mapper (ORM) is one of the most-loved features of the framework. Eloquent makes it easy to connect to relational data in a database and work with it using Object-Oriented models in your Laravel app. It is simple to setup, easy to use, and packs a lot of power.
